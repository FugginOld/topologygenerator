# topologygenerator

[![CI](https://github.com/FugginOld/topologygenerator/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FugginOld/topologygenerator/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Two topology tools in one repo:

1. **Network topology** — auto-discover a homelab network from live sources,
   normalize into one canonical model, render as an animated HTML dashboard,
   Graphviz SVG, or git-diffable Mermaid. *(the original pipeline, below)*
2. **Hardware topology + fleet dashboard** — scan each machine's real hardware
   fabric (CPU, RAM, PCIe lanes, NVMe, NICs with link state, USB, displays) and
   watch every machine on your network from **one live dashboard**, with per-host
   CPU/net/disk telemetry. *See **[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md)** for the full setup.*

The repo is the **tooling**. Your actual topology (IPs, MACs, hostnames, VLAN
policy) is a *build artifact* and is gitignored — see [Security](#security).

## Hardware topology + fleet dashboard

Map the real hardware of every machine on your network and watch them live:

```text
   Windows PC ─┐  ./agent/report.sh  (or agent\report.ps1)
   Linux box  ─┼──►  topology_server.py on one host  ──►  live dashboard, one card per machine
   Proxmox    ─┘     (POST /api/ingest + telemetry)
```

- One **server** runs `python renderers/html/topology_server.py`; open `http://HOST:8770`.
- Each machine runs an **agent** that scans its own hardware and pushes its
  topology and live telemetry (`agent/report.sh` on Linux, `agent/report.ps1` on Windows, or
  the `bootstrap.sh` one-liner for a fresh Debian box).
- Scanners: `scanners/make_pc_topology.py` (Windows, PnP/CIM) and `scanners/make_linux_topology.py`
  (Linux, sysfs/proc). Live metrics: `core/local_telemetry.py` (real CPU temp on Linux).

Full step-by-step — server firewall, each reporting machine, persistence,
naming, tokens, troubleshooting — is in **[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md)**.

## How it works

```text
sources ──▶ collectors ──▶ topology.json ──▶ renderers
(live)      (read-only)     (canonical)       (html / svg / mermaid)
```

Every collector is read-only and emits raw dicts. `core/normalize.py` merges
them into one `Topology` (deduped by MAC, then reconciled by IP and hostname),
`core/enrich.py` adds vendor/kind, and renderers consume only the canonical
model — so you can add outputs without touching collection.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt            # only PyYAML is required
python renderers/html/topology_server.py   # http://localhost:8770
```

On a Linux host, `./install.sh` sets the dashboard up as a systemd service
(starts on boot, prints its own URL); `./uninstall.sh` removes it. See
[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md).

Open the dashboard and click **SCAN NETWORK** — with no config at all it
ping-sweeps your subnet and, if it doesn't recognise a gateway collector,
**fingerprints your router** and tells you which one to enable (e.g. *"gateway
192.168.1.1 looks like UNIFI — add a `unifi` API key"*). Then:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml         # edit — this file is gitignored
# enable unifi / proxmox / etc. with their API keys, then re-scan
```

Prefer the CLI? `python scanners/make_network_topology.py --config config.yaml` writes
`out/topology.json` + `.svg` + `.mmd` directly.

**Adding a machine to the fleet:** right-click any host in the network map →
*Generate machine topology*. If SSH remote-scan is configured it scans over SSH;
otherwise it hands you the one-line `bootstrap.sh` command to run on that host
(persistent service, or `TOPO_ONCE=1` for a one-off snapshot).

## Collectors

| Collector    | Source                          | Adds                                          | Needs                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `unifi`      | UniFi controller API (UCG/UDM)  | **VLAN zones**, clients, gateway + WAN, uplinks | API key *(stdlib, no deps)* |
| `proxmox`    | Proxmox VE API                  | **VMs + LXC** (incl. NAT'd) nested under host  | API token *(PVEAuditor)*    |
| `pingsweep`  | OS `ping` + ARP cache           | live hosts, MAC, vendor — **zero install**     | — *(Windows-friendly)*      |
| `arpscan`    | `arp-scan` / `nmap -sn`         | live hosts, MAC, vendor                        | arp-scan or nmap (Linux)    |
| `opnsense`   | OPNsense REST API               | VLAN zones, DHCP names, ARP                    | API key/secret              |
| `unifi_snmp` | SNMP LLDP + FDB                 | **physical switch-port edges**, uplinks        | net-snmp, SNMP on switch    |
| `docker`     | `docker ps` over SSH            | containers nested under hosts                  | key-based SSH               |
| `tailscale`  | `tailscale status --json`       | overlay mesh (tagged `ts`)                     | tailscale                   |
| `dns`        | Pi-hole / hosts file            | friendly names                                 | —                           |

MAC is the primary join key; nodes are then reconciled by IP and hostname so a
host seen by three collectors collapses into one. `unifi`/`proxmox`/`pingsweep`
are **stdlib-only** (no `requests`); the gateway/API collectors auto-degrade to
`[]` when their source is absent, so enabling several is safe.

## Renderers

- **`renderers/html/`** — animated dashboard (VLAN zones, firewall hub, Tailscale
  overlay toggle, click-to-isolate). Reads `topology.json`; refreshes every 30s.
- **`renderers/static_svg.py`** — Graphviz `dot` → SVG/PNG for README/wiki.
- **`renderers/mermaid.py`** — `topology.mmd`, renders on GitHub, diffs cleanly.

## Automation

Runs on a homelab host, not GitHub Actions (Actions can't reach your LAN). See
`systemd/` for a timer that regenerates the map every 10 minutes. If you want
history/diffing, snapshot each `topology.json` into SQLite and diff runs.

## Security

Your generated topology is a map of your network. **Keep it out of git.**
`.gitignore` already excludes `config.yaml`, `out/`, `*.raw.json`, and
`topology.json`. Recommended: keep this repo **private**. If public, only ever
commit the tooling and `config.example.yaml` (dummy values). One accidental
`git add -A` of a build artifact leaks the whole layout.
