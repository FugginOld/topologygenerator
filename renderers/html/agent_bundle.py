"""The reporting agent's file set, packed as a tar.gz / zip the server serves to
fresh machines. bootstrap.sh fetches /agent.tar.gz and extracts it, so clients
run the client code from THIS server, not github.

Lifted out of topo_server.py: a pure bytes producer over the repo tree. To ship
new agent-side code to clients, edit AGENT_PATHS here, restart the server, then
re-run bootstrap on the client (see CLAUDE.md → Conventions).
